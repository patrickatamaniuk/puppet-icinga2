# == Class: icinga2::params
#
# This class is intentionally empty. It just serves as a container class for other
# icinga2::object:: classes to make the module's file layout cleaner (all object defined types
# can be put into an objects/ subdirectory)
#
# === Parameters
#
# None. See inline comments for parameters on the individual object type manifests for 
# more details.
